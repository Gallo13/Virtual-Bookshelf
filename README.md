# Virtual-Bookshelf
Virtual bookshelf Website using Python, Flask, HTML, and MySQL

This virtual bookshelf uses HTML, CSS, WS-CSS, and Bootstrap on the front end to create and style the website. It also uses Python with Flask to make the backend and connects to MySQL with MySQL connector.

It takes input such as Title, Author, Genre, Publisher, Pages, and personal Rating (on a scale of 1-5). That input gets appended to the MySQL database.

FUTURE:
- It will show analytics on what kind of books I generally read, my average book length and my average book ratings, most read genre, and most read author.
- will have a book recommender for future books based on what I've read
